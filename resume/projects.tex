    {Pacman AI}
    {Unity 2019.4.1}
    {December 2020 - January 2021}
    {
        \begin{cvitems}
            \item University project to implement behaviour trees for Pacman ghosts
            \item Designed and implemented three unique behaviors - Scout, Guard, and Pursuit
            \item Agents designed to work together - Scout relays players position to other agents while avoiding conflict with the player
            \item Implemented agent 'memory', so agents remember the position of pills and the player and act only on this info
        \end{cvitems}

    {May 2020 - August 2020}
    {
        \begin{cvitems}
            \item Designed code structure for complex weapon system with loot spawning, weapon modifications, and fire modes
            \item Systems designed to interface with a custom network designed by another programmer
            \item Implemented majority of the systems, including setting up recoil so it could be driven by IK systems

    % {Snake}
    % {C++ OpenGL}
    % {July 2019}
    % {
    %     \begin{cvitems}
    %         \item Developed and implemented in OpenGL for C++
    %         \item Programmed a game of snake including collision detection and random 'apple' placement
    %         \item Displays players score upon death without the use of text as a challenge to see if the information could still be conveyed clearly
    %         \item Set up initial conditions so the game could be restarted with a single key press
    %         % \item Scaled movement speed with the length of the snake to increase the difficulty as the player does better 
    %     \end{cvitems}

    % {January 2019 - March 2019}
    % {
    %     \begin{cvitems}
    %         \item Used an iterative method to find the best dimensions for a rocket powered glider from know boundaries
    %         \item V1.1 was optimisation and reduced the run time by 60\%

    % {January 2019 - March 2019}
    % {
    %     \begin{cvitems}
    %         \item Used OOP to create a script to take a rocket from the launch pad to a sub-orbital path
    %         \item Improved the script to automatically circularise the orbit once a sub-orbital trajectory is achieved
