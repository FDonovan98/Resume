\begin{cvparagraph}
    I am an avid programmer and passionate producer, with a strong knowledge of version control using Git, agile methodology, and an excitement for facing new, interesting challenges. I have lead teams which have published to both Itch and Steam, always with a focus on maintaining healthy and flexible working practices. My ideal position would be an Associate Producer role, with a strong focus on growing my skills and experience so I could progress to a more senior position.
