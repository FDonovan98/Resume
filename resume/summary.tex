\begin{cvparagraph}
    I am an artist with a non-traditional background, coming from programming and production. I fell in love with game art while working as a producer alongside artists creating and publishing games during my undergrad, and since have been pursuing a masters in game art. My background gives me an aptitude for picking up and learning new software and technical principles quickly, and I have excelled at learning, adapting, and experimenting with new workflows. My production experience has given me a strong grounding in agile methodology and helped train my flexibility, helping me understand and utilise the different stages of production, and helping me communicate and work well in a team of mixed skills and abilities.

    Like most people in games, I'm a massive nerd. I love film, and love how my masters has given me a deeper appreciation for the medium as I started to learn and analyse how composition and especially lighting were set up in a shot and why. I've also got into Warhammer 40k for its deep and at times wildly over the top lore, and have recently bought a 3D printer, which may be the coolest purchase I've ever made.
